  "summary": "The CV is excessively long at 4 pages with 191 bullet points, far exceeding the recommended 1-2 pages and 77 bullet points maximum. There is significant repetition and many generic, vague, or weak statements that dilute impact. Numerous duplicate or near-duplicate responsibilities appear across roles, especially around sprint planning, retrospectives, stakeholder communication, backlog prioritization, and process flow diagrams. The CV lacks consistent use of metrics and strong action verbs in many places. To be competitive for top-tier roles, this CV requires ruthless pruning by deleting weak/generic content, removing duplicates, and consolidating similar points into concise, impactful statements with measurable outcomes or clear business impact. Many bullet points are passive or vague and should be either removed or rewritten with stronger language and specific results. The candidate should focus on achievements and quantifiable impact rather than listing routine responsibilities or process descriptions. Overall, the CV currently risks rejection due to length, repetition, and lack of focus on results.",

There are numerous duplicate or near-duplicate bullet points across roles, especially around sprint planning, retrospectives, stakeholder communication, backlog prioritisation, and process flow diagrams. Many bullet points are generic, passive, or describe routine responsibilities without measurable outcomes. The candidate must aggressively cut at least 60% of content, remove duplicates, delete weak/generic points, and strengthen the remaining bullets with metrics or clearer impact statements.

It contains many generic, vague, and repetitive statements across roles, with multiple near-duplicate responsibilities and weak impact descriptions. There is a lack of consistent metrics or measurable outcomes, and many bullet points use passive or weak language. The candidate must aggressively cut redundant and low-value content, consolidate duplicates, and strengthen the strongest achievements with clear metrics or impact statements.
